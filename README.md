# Polling App
This polling app features a landing page where a random poll question is displayed along with a list of possible responses. Once the user submits a response, the page redirects to a new view that displays the question and response frequencies in the form of a bar chart. Upon returning to the homepage, a new random question will be asked. User can answer the same question more than once.
